CONFIGURATION

There is a video on how to use media_cloudcast here: http://vimeo.com/65594252

Once media_cloudcast is installed, there is a configuration page at Configuration > Cloudcast Video Control. 

In addition, make sure your video display is set up properly by both checking that your media field display is set to 'rendered file' and 'default' and that your overall video file settings are using Cloudcast at Structure > File Types > Manage File Display (of video). Watch the above screencast for more help on configuration.
